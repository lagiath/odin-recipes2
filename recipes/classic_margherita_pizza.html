    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Margherita pizza is a classic Italian dish that is loved for its simplicity and fresh, flavorful ingredients. This pizza is made with a thin crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and is topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves.</p>

        <p>The tomato sauce is made from ripe, juicy tomatoes that are cooked down to a thick, rich sauce with a touch of garlic and olive oil. The sauce is then spread over the pizza dough, and topped with slices of fresh mozzarella cheese. The cheese melts beautifully in the oven, creating a gooey, creamy layer on top of the pizza.</p>

        <p>To finish off the pizza, fresh basil leaves are scattered over the top, adding a fragrant, herbaceous note to the dish. The result is a delicious, satisfying pizza that is both light and flavorful.</p>

        <p>Margherita pizza is a perfect meal for any occasion, whether it's a quick weeknight dinner or a fun weekend gathering with friends and family. It's a classic dish that never goes out of style, and is sure to please everyone at the table.</p>
